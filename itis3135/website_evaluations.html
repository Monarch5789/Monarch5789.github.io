            <h3><a href="https://spotlessagency.com">Spotless Agency</a></h3>
            <p>Spotless Agency is a website that appears dedicated to staging houses prior to sale, as well as a number of related services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">C:</span> This page has strong contrast, but not in a harsh manner. The text is always distinct from the background, but not enough to cause discomfort</li>
                <li><span class="bold">R:</span> This page makes good use of repetition, as each new section keeps the same font sizes, colors, and headings.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">A:</span> The alignment on this page is also good, as nothing ends up overlaping or intruding on anything else.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">P:</span> Finally the proximity on this page is also good, as nothing feels cramped, and the content is not on the edge of the screen.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, this website does follow the CRAP principles well, and looks pretty good.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://thebiguglywebsite.com">The Big Ugly Website</a></h3>
            <p>The Big Ugly Website is a seemingly intentionally designed website that displays many violations of the CRAP principles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">C:</span> This page struggles with some harsh contrast, most notably with the background, but also some highlighting.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">R:</span> This page also struggles with repetition, as many elements are different, and stand out in a negative light.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">A:</span> This page has some alignment issues with the images near the top, as they start to move into the other "column" of elements.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">P:</span> Finally, this page has proximity issues, with many elements being too close to the edge of the screen.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, this website does not follow the CRAP principles very well, and is a good example of things to avoid.</p>
