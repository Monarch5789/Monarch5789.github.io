                <p>Checklist:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Submission: Correct Link</li>
                    <li>File/folder names: Correct formatting</li>
                    <li>Design
                    <li class="indented">Contrast: Harsh. Links are hard to read, black text on dark green is harsh. Red/Green is high contrast. Check WCAG for more.</li>
                    <li class="indented">Correct CSS File: Yes (though through vercel)</li>
                    <li class="indented"><span class="bold">C:</span> Contrast is a little harsh, consider some different colors unless you believe the contrast to be integral to the site's purpose.</li>
                    <li class="indented"><span class="bold">R:</span> Repetition is solid, elements repeat themselves in a predictable way, consider possibly cropping or editing your images to be roughly the same size. </li>
                    <li class="indented"><span class="bold">A: </span>Some challenges with vertical alignment on the homepage, but horizontally everything is good. </li>
                    <li class="indented"><span class="bold">P: </span>Proximity feels a little dense on the homepage with some of the images. </li>
                    <li>Page Contains:</li>
                    <li class="indented"><span class="bold">Header &check;</span></li>
                    <li class="indented"><span class="bold">Main &check;</span></li>
                    <li class="indented"><span class="bold">Footer &check;</span></li>
                    <li class="indented"><span class="bold">NAV &check;</span></li>
                    <li class="indented">Note that the above are based on a visual inspection rather than checking code, as this was deployed through REACT and the original code is not accessible to me.</li>
                    <li>Header has site/brand header with text in an h1: Yes.</li>
                    <li>Main starts with name of page as an H2 and does not include name of site/brand: Only Home does, other pages do not.</li>
                    <li>Page has brand tagline somewhere (make up a slogan and include it on every page in a consistent location): No</li>
                    <li>Page has footer with:</li>
                    <li class="indented">Menu for users pages: No</li>
                    <li class="indented">Validation (accumulus or otherwise): No</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Following section from Client Project - Part 2 Rubric</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Consistency of Layout: Indeterminate as only 1 page appears complete</li>
                    <li>Nav Bar consistent location and all links work: Yes</li>
                    <li>Product/Service Pages appropriate content: No, only the home and "Locations" pages have appropriate content.</li>
                    <li>URL: Correct (I'm not sure if the assignment is okay with Vercel, you'll have to ask a TA about that)</li>
                    <li>Documentation: N/A</li>
                    <li>Aesthetics: In my opinion website is not aesthetically pleasing, but is easy to navigate.</li>
